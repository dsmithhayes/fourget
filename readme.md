=======

`fourget` is a basic command line utility built in PHP used to
scrape and download all the images from a single thread on any 4chan
imageboard.

## Usage

    fourget http://boards.4chan.org/g/thread/39894014/the-g-wiki

Or

    fourget https://boards.4chan.org/g/thread/39894014/the-g-wiki wiki

The latter will create a new directory called `wiki`.

*Note*: you must use a full URL.
